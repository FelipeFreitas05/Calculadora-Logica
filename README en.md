LogicApex - Boolean Logic Calculator

LogicApex is an interactive and educational boolean logic calculator, created with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and pure JavaScript. It allows users to visualize the results of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) in real-time, as well as build and analyze complex boolean equations with a step-by-step truth table.

✨ Features

° Real-Time Calculator: Select the input values (A, B, C) and a logic gate to see the result instantly.

° 3-Input Support: Enable "Input C" for more complex calculations with most gates.

° Didactic Explanations: Each logic gate (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR) comes with a clear and easy-to-understand explanation.

° Truth Table per Gate: Automatically generates the complete truth table for the selected logic gate (with 2 or 3 inputs).

° Equation Builder: Write your own custom logic equations.

° Smart Parser: The equation parser understands operators in English (AND, OR, NOT) and in Portuguese (E, OU, NÃO, NE, NOU, XOU).

° Detailed Truth Table: The custom equation's table shows the result of each step of the logic (e.g., (A AND B) and (NOT C)) before showing the final result of ((A AND B) OR (NOT C)).

° Responsive Design: Fully functional and beautiful on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

° The project was built entirely with front-end web technologies, with no need for build tools or frameworks.

° HTML5: Semantic structure of the site.

° Tailwind CSS: For fast, modern, and responsive styling.

° JavaScript (Vanilla): For all the calculator's logic, DOM manipulation, and the equation parser.
